    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Your kids will love these chocolate chip pancakes that are light and fluffy and loaded with gooey chocolate.</p><p> You can also sprinkle the chocolate chips on top once the pancakes are on the griddle instead of folding them into the batter — that way you can adjust the amount of chocolate chips per pancake.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>3/4 cup milk </li>

      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar </li>
      
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      
      <li>2 tbs white sugar</li>
      
      <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
      
     <li>1/2 tsp baking soda </li>
      
      <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
      
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      
      <li>1/2 cup mini chocolate chips, or more to taste </li>
      
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>To make the buttermilk: Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to sour the milk.</li>
<li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
<li>Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into buttermilk mixture until well combined; add flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. The pancake batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.</li>

<li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.</li>
      <li>Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately.</li>

</ol>
